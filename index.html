        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hey there! My name’s Patrick and I’m learning to become a fullstack
          developer and exercise my creative gears! If you ever met me, you
          might think I’m like the Big Bang: an explosion of energy that makes
          something out of nothing! I am a very energetic young man with a
          passion for creating, building, developing, especially when it comes
          to art and technology. I’m sure you could agree that technology has
          created a whole new dimension when it comes to all forms of media by
          providing new mediums, and increasing interconnectivity. These types
          of ideas blow my mind and give me a dopamine rush the same way that
          finally wiring up an app does. There’s just something about the moment
          when your functions work correctly that keep you wanting more to do
          and more to learn! I like to think of coding as my “left-brain
          exercise,” and to balance out my brain I’m also learning to play
          guitar, I produce music digitally, write, paint, draw, oh man, I like
          to dip my hands in just about anything and see what I can do! And I
          think it’s very important to note how much I love people and enjoy
          working with them. You all are so very unique, interesting and just
          fun! I think this is sufficient, Patrick out !

          Project 1: Quiz App Very basic functionality, creating an app that
          tests your knowledge on Greek mythology! Very fun designing this and
          making it easy on the eyes, as well as linking it all into one
          comprehensive whole. I used vscode and git bash!
