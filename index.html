        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
          Hey there! My name’s Patrick and I’m a
          <strong>full-stack developer</strong> looking to spin my creative
          gears! If you ever met me, you might think I’m like the Big Bang:
          <em>an explosion of energy that makes something out of nothing</em>!
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I like to think of coding as my “left-brain exercise,” and to balance
          out the right side I’m also learning how to play guitar, producing
          music, writing, painting, drawing, oh man, I like to dip my hands in
          just about anything and see what I can do! And I think it’s very
          important to note how much I love people and enjoy working with them.
          Together we accomplish great things! Just look around!
        </p>

            <strong>Greek Mythology Quiz App:</strong> Very basic functionality,
            an app for anyone who would like to test their knowledge on Greek mythology! The app walks the user through five questions on Greek mythology while keeping the user updated on their current score and progress, complete with feedback! It was very fun designing this for the purpose of putting my abilities with the programming languages listed below to the test!
